# Japan 2024 <br />
<br />
Earlier this year, I embarked on a journey with friends to Japan, exploring the cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. 
To capture the essence of this adventure, I developed an interactive map using Leaflet.js. 
The page dynamically showcases the days we spent in each location, highlighting the landmarks and places we visited, 
offering a detailed and immersive visualization of our travel experience. <br />
Currently the project highlights the calendar days that I was there as well as
a few places I visited during each day displayed through markers on the leaftlet map.
